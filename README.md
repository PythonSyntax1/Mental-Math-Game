# Mental-Math-Game 

This is an Android application that creates Math quizzes in either Open ended or Multiple choice mode. As of September 4th, it is still
incomplete, but the majority of the functionality for both game modes are working, as well as the results screen, which saves high scores
from both game modes. In future commits, there will be another game mode added, as well as improvement to the UI.
